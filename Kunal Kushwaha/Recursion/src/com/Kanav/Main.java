     * How function calls work in languages:
     * While the function is not finished executing, it will remain in stack.
     * When a function finished executing it is removed from stack, and the flow of program is restored to
     * where that function was called.
     *
     * Base Condition:
     * Condition where our recursion will stop making new calls.
     *
     * No Base Condition:
     * Function call will keep happening, stack will be filled again and again.
     * Therefore, the memory of the computer will be exceeded and the program will stop.
     * This is called stackoverflow error.
     *
     * Why recursion?
     * 1) It helps us to solve bigger/complex programs in a simple way/
     * 2) You can convert recursion solution into iteration & vice versa.
     * 3) Space complexity is not constant because of recursive calls.
     * 4) It helps us in breaking down bigger problems into smaller problems.
     *
     * How to approach and solve a problem using recursion?
     * 1) Identify if you can break down problem into smaller problems.
     * 2) Write the recurrence relation if needed.
     * 3) Draw the recursive tree.
     * 4) About the tree:
         * i) See the flow of functions, how they are getting stacked.
         * ii) identify & focus on left tree calls and right tree calls.
         * iii) Draw the tree and pointer again and again using pen & paper.
         * iv) Use a debugger to see the flow of the code.
     * 5) See how the values & and what type of values are returned at each step. Then see where
     * the function will come out. In the end you will come out of the main function.
